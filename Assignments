RAflection IN JAVA :

The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.
