REFLECTION IN JAVA:

Java Reflection is a process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time. The java. lang. Class class provides many methods that can be used to get metadata, examine and change the run time behavior of a class.
Reflection API in Java is used to manipulate class and its members which include fields , methods , constructors , etc. at runtime. Reflection API in java can manipulate private members of class too.

.The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.

.Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.

.Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

Class in java.lang.reflect Package:

Following is a list of various Java classes in java.lang.package to implement reflection-

.Field: This class is used to gather declarative information such as datatype, access modifier, name and value of a variable.

.Method: This class is used to gather declarative information such as access modifier, return type, name, parameter types and exception type of a method.

.Constructor: This class is used to gather declarative information such as access modifier, name and parameter types of a constructor.
Modifier: This class is used to gather information about a particular access modifier.

Methods used in java.lang.Class:

.Public String getName (): Returns the name of the class.

.public Class getSuperclass(): Returns the super class reference

.Public Class[] getInterfaces() : Returns an array of interfaces implemented by the specified class

.Public in getModifiers (): Returns an integer value representing the modifiers of the specified class which needs to be passed as a parameter to “public static String toString (int i )” method which returns the access specifier for the given class.
